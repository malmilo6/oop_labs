## lab_oop_100

In this laboratory work main task was to implement inheritance in our previous project.
There is a diagram, which explains the principles of the project below.
I decided to make one etnity parent class - RootClass, which provide an ID to all his child classes.
Next step was to define intermideate classe. Here theare are Person, Order, Staff, LogIn, Dishes. From these classes next child classes inherit certain properties and also have their own.
